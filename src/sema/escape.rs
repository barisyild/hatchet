//! Whole-program escape / ownership analysis — the principled replacement for the
//! scattered heuristics in `codegen/ownership.rs`.
//!
//! Per function it tracks where each heap `new` allocation comes to rest — its single
//! owner — and classifies it; per class it derives the fields the destructor must
//! free. The goal is sound *conservative* ownership: every allocation gets exactly one
//! owner, or is left unowned (leaked) when ambiguous, so the failure mode is a leak
//! rather than a double-free. Constructor-argument ownership is resolved
//! interprocedurally (directly and transitively through nested owning constructors),
//! a call to a same-class method that returns a fresh allocation transfers ownership
//! to the caller, and a class field whose owned object is handed back out is downgraded
//! to a leak (the aliasing/soundness guard).
//!
//! **Deliberately unsupported (conservatively leaked, never double-freed):**
//! * *General method / free-function call summaries* — a `new` passed to a call other
//!   than a constructor or a same-class owned-returning method (e.g. `obj.foo(new X())`)
//!   is treated as escaping. Resolving it needs call-site receiver type inference, which
//!   lives in codegen, not here.
//! * *Borrowed-param-then-fresh-`new`* — the divergence where the old heuristic frees a
//!   fresh `new` at the caller's scope while this pass leaks it. Safe (a leak), left to
//!   reconcile at the M5 cutover.
//!
//! Codegen still runs on the old heuristics; this module is built and validated
//! alongside them until the M5 cutover.
